This Project is the code of my resume webpage.

This page is made using vite and react.

run development:
```shell
npm run dev
```

make production:
```shell
vite build
```

Sidenote: uses the github API without needing to provide a token, as a result the API calls have an hourly limit. SO loading the project page
multiple times can cause an hour timeout.
